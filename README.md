APOD Search (Astronomy picture of the day)

My capstone includes two html files (1 completed homepage), two javascript files, and two css files (homepage css styles completed). 

For the home page, it displays the picture of the day, along with a title, photographer name, and submission date. The image, name and date should be replaced using javascript (text replacement for the titles and dates, image replacement for img link) when selecting a different date (using the callendar in the menu). Underneath the image is a general website description that will not change, and a copyright within the paragraph div.

Part of the home page is also a slide out menu with hidden scroll functionality. This menu uses javascript for the slide out functionality. at desktop sizes, the menu width expands to 300px, but for mobile styles (tablet and phone) it covers the page when opened. The links under the menu are "today's picture" (default), "Yesterday's Picture" (to be changed with javascript), "Favourite Pictures" (a seperate html page that will have a grid of favourited images), and "Random Picture"(to be changed with javascript). At the bottom of the menu is a date input forum for selecting a specific date (along with a submit button). Finally there is a copyright placed at the bottom of the menu.
